scala-js-facades
================

- Goal is to have a centralized location for scala-js-facades. Similar to github.com/borisyankov/DeinitelyTyped.
- Please feel free to submit PR to add new facades. If you'd rather your facade stays in your repository, please edit the LIST file to point to your repository.
- Fastest way to contribute: Run https://github.com/sjrd/scala-js-ts-importer on https://github.com/borisyankov/DefinitelyTyped for the library you're using currently, commit to scala-js-facades and submit a PR.
